#           Centos/7 box has some known issues as mentioned in (https://seven.centos.org/2016/06/updated-centos-vagrant-images-available/) centos website. 
#           These issues may be a problem at the later phase of development where we will be using such functionalities.

#  memory: Memory can be modified for each box.  
#  vcpu: same as memory it can also be modified.
